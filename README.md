# Folha Popup Dismiss

Simple Chrome's extension to read [folha.com.br](http://folha.com.br) articles for free.
(_PS: Nowadays you can read the articles for free, opening it in a private tab too, so this extension is useless..._)

## Install

Pack the extension using Chrome's tool in "Settings -> Tools -> Extensions" (_enable developer mode to enable "Load unpacked extesion" buttom_)
or download the [Extension on Dropbpx](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kmpq7bleicjvn9a/folha-for-free.crx) , and visit `chrome://extensions` and drang and drop the file `folha-for-free.crx` to install the extension.
